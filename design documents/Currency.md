# Currency

## 2022-09-17
The currency in the game was changed from gold to silver and where the weight and size of a particular metal is used as a method of evaluating value, as opposed to the value being determined by the specific type of coin where the weight is about 1,6g.

The currency in the game was changed from having the old classic gold,silver,copper to one single currency gold. This was changed
to make it a bit more simple as having more types more or less just complicates things and dont add any real ingame value.
