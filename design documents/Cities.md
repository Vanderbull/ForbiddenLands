## Uppåkra

Excavations show Uppåkra to have been among the richest and largest towns active during the Viking Age. Its founding was likely several centuries earlier, possibly as far back as the year 100 BC.

Archaeological surveys in 1934 discovered a Bronze to Iron Age settlement. More recently, 30,000 objects of gold, silver and bronze were discovered, telling many stories of the area. The advanced craftsmanship indicates that significant trade took place with ancient Europe and the Middle East.

## Uppsala

The scenes from Vikings set in Uppsala are shocking, but they're not entirely fiction. The settlement, now Gamla Uppsala (Old Uppsala) just north of Stockholm, served as a centre of society for hundreds of years, before and during the Viking Age.

Uppsala was the location of a general assembly and a major marketplace, held annually from pre-historic times to the Middle Ages in the early spring. Written sources claim that these gatherings were used to decide warfare plans. A Norse religious celebration called Dísablót was also held, which could have involved sacrifice.
