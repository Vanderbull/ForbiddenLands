Trying to fix the none working loading of character data.

Moved the SActor to the gameengine instead of the gamestate

So now it is working

Got to thinking that the play button should not be visible until you actually loaded a game or be replaced with a "Start new game" or something along those lines.

When loading the game starts and then there are different menus in game and you can only go back to the main menu.
