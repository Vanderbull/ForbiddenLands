# Shops & traders
This might not be a feature in the first version of the game due to the fact that you will accumulate items from raiding and then store them at home as loot.
There is no real reason at first to sell anything at a vendor of some sort.

- Tiers 1,2,3
- Shops can have random items from lower tiers
- Random generated at first but keeps its inventory persistant.
- Each shop have a primary tier and a secondary tier. ( maybe )
