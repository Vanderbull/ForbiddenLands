## Skill tree v.s Skill list
https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/57553/when-should-i-use-skill-trees-versus-skill-lists-in-an-rpg

Summary: Lists provide more agency, while trees provide more easily anticipated results that are simpler to balance and utilize in design.

To be as concise as possible, the difference between lists and trees of decisions is the level of freedom the individual making the choices has.

When speaking of skills and character progression specifically, lists such as found in Elder Scrolls provide freeform decision making. Trees provide a more guided approach, usually representing classes or sub-classes of some form. There is less freedom in character progression/creation, as the concept of a tree necessitates requirements to unlock latter levels/branches.

The freeform list provides a greater sense of agency for the player, allowing a greater number of options. The more guided tree provides a simpler system to consider and anticipate as a designer, resulting in a system easier to balance. So, the end result is that you have a choice for a potentially more balanced system versus a system that provides more agency.

So, the end result is that you have a choice for a potentially more balanced system versus a system that provides more agency.

To answer your edit questions:

    Complexity largely depends on the specifics of implementation. However, all else being equal, a freeform system is far more complex as the potential number of results are significantly higher.

    Yes, the traditional usage of the two is for lists to be atomic actions (such as Elder Scrolls' system) while trees are used for "Perks" or "Abilities" to simulate a focus on developing enhanced skills in a specific domain. However, this is hardly a requirement.

    Much changed between Morrowind and Skyrim, largely due to a number of decisions far too complex to attribute simply to "using a list-based skill system".

A skill tree works usually better in a scenario, where:

    The skill points are limited,
    Skills provide a more significant advantage,
    The game 'feels' better, if the player characters are more specialized (the character classes / roles are easier to distinguish).

The Elder Scrolls - style skill advancement is on the other hand:

    More realistic,
    Encourages players to try many different approaches (the player won't have a significant disadvantage if he switches from melee to magic at level 30, for example),
    Easier to balance,
    Provides a feel of continuous progression (no "the best skill is unlocked at level 30 in the fire magic skill tree, I'll just try to survive until then" effect).

In my opinion, the Elder Scrolls approach is more viable in a single-player game. The player doesn't have to start over if he wants to try a different play style. In Morrowind for example, you can be an armored melee fighter for the first 30 levels or so - and then decide to try the thieving skills / quests without receiving any penalty (or having to create a new character and start from level 1).

## Currency

### 2022-01-21
The currency in the game was changed from having the old classic gold,silver,copper to one single currency gold. This was changed
to make it a bit more simple as having more types more or less just complicates things and dont add any real ingame value.

## Races

### DWARF
Dwarfs are a short and burly race, living in mountain fastnesses
underground. They are loyal friends and fi erce adversaries,
known for their steadfastness in all things.
The dwarfs are inherently resistant to many spells and spell-like
effects. Dwarfi sh characters gain bonuses against the use of
most magic, including all spells, wands, rods, and staves. The
amount of the bonus depends upon the dwarf’s constitution:
every 3.5 points of constitution (rounding down fractions)
grants a bonus of +1 against such magic. Moreover, the hardy
dwarfi sh nature imparts a 22-01-21similar bonus on any saving throws
against poison.
Dwarfs are not a numerous folk, but they are adventurous,
loving the lustre of gold, the glitter of gems, and the quality
of well-wrought metals. Dwarfs can live to an age of 350 years
or more.

#### Summary of dwarﬁsh Racial abilities:
- +1 constitution, -1 charisma (with respect to all but
dwarfs)
- +1 to hit against goblins, half-orcs, hobgoblins, and orcs
- +1 bonus per 3.5 points of Con to saves against magic and
poison
- -4 penalty to any attacks made against the dwarf by giants,
ogres, ogre mages, titans and trolls.

- languages: Dwarfish, gnomish, goblin, kobold, and orcish,
and the common tongue and the appropriate alignment
tongue. Regardless of intelligence, a dwarf may only ever learn
two languages in addition to those listed.

- Infravision * : 60 ft
Within ten ft, a dwarf can detect certain facts concerning
engineering, stonework, etc. Although no signifi cant time is
required, the character must deliberately observe his or her
surroundings (i.e., the player must state that the dwarf is using
this particular talent in order to gain information).
- Detect the existence of slopes or grades: 75%
- Detect the existence of new construction: 75%
- Detect sliding or shifting rooms or walls: 66%
- Detect traps involving stonework: 50%
- Determine depth underground: 50%

### Teleport
```c++
void teleport(int dest_x , int dest_y, int& src_x, int& src_y)
{
    src_x=dest_x;
    src_y=dest_y;
}

teleport(4,4,PlayerCoordinate.x,PlayerCoordinate.y);
```

- On target
The caster appears in the correct location.
- Off target
The caster appears safely, a random distance away
from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target
is 1d10x1d10% of the distance that was to be travelled. The
direction off target is determined randomly
- Similar area
The caster winds up in an area that is visually or
thematically (depending on how the caster identifi ed it while
casting) similar to the target area. It is possible (25% chance)
that this result will indicate that the correct location has been
reached but that the caster and party will arrive too high, fall-
ing 1d% ft unless there is means to arrest the fall. If the party
arrives too high and the result would entomb them in a solid
surface, they die instantly. Generally, the caster will appear
in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists
within the spell’s range, the spell simply fails.
- Mishap
The caster and anyone else teleporting with him or
her arrive beneath the destination point, causing instant death
if the area is solid.

### Bless ( Reversible )
- Clerical Conjuration/Summoning
- level: Cleric 1
- Range: 60 ft
- duration: 6 rounds
- area of effect: 50 x 50 ft
- components: V,S,M
- casting time: 1 round
- Saving throw: None

<p>
This minor benison raises the morale and attack rolls of any
creatures allied with the casting cleric by +1 or +5% as appro-
priate. Any creatures already engaged in melee combat will
not gain the spell’s benefi ts. The spell is reversible, allowing
the cleric to curse his or her enemies with—5% morale and
–1 to hit.
The spell’s area of effect is a circular area centred at the tar-
get point, which cannot be more than 60 ft from the cleric.
Holy water is required to cast the spell (unholy water for the
reverse).

- Range: 10 ft
- duration: Instantaneous (permanent)
- area of effect: Up to 30 cubic ft
- components: V,S,M

<p>
This spell creates potable water, four gallons per level of the
caster. The water may be created in a receptacle or in thin
air (whence it will, of course, fall). Water cannot be created
inside a creature, nor can it be created in any place the caster
cannot see. The reverse of the spell destroys water (including
fog, steam, mist, etc.) in the same quantities as create water .

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].  

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.  
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.  
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.

Table of Contents: Optionally, include a table of contents in order to allow other people to quickly navigate especially long or detailed READMEs.

Installation: Installation is the next section in an effective README. Tell other users how to install your project locally. Optionally, include a gif to make the process even more clear for other people.

Usage: The next section is usage, in which you instruct other people on how to use your project after they’ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.

Contributing: Larger projects often have sections on contributing to their project, in which contribution instructions are outlined. Sometimes, this is a separate file. If you have specific contribution preferences, explain them so that other developers know how to best contribute to your work. To learn more about how to help others contribute, check out the guide for setting guidelines for repository contributors.

Credits: Include a section for credits in order to highlight and link to the authors of your project.

License: Finally, include a section for the license of your project. For more information on choosing a license, check out GitHub’s licensing guide!

Your README should contain only the necessary information for developers to get started using and contributing to your project. Longer documentation is best suited for wikis, outlined below.
